# Concurrent-Programming-in-Java


Multi Core Processors = capable of executing computations in parallel.

Computations can be divided into smaller subproblems, eachof which can be solved simutaneously.

Speed Up is the only reason for parallel programming.

Parallel and Concurrent programming are not the same thing.
